# PrajaShakti — प्रजाशक्ति

## What Is This Project?

PrajaShakti ("Power of the Citizens") is a civic engagement platform for India. It connects citizens in real time to collectively identify public issues, pressure government officials and bureaucrats, and demand accountability. The platform takes micro-donations (as low as ₹1/day) from citizens, uses a portion for operating costs to stay fully self-sufficient, and donates the rest to randomly selected 80G-certified non-profit organisations. All bank statements are public. No government, political, or corporate funding is accepted — ever.

**Sanskrit motto:** यत्र प्रजाशक्तिः तत्र सुशासनम् — "Where there is the power of citizens, there is good governance"

**Framework:** इच्छा (Desire) → ज्ञान (Knowledge) → क्रिया (Action)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)

## App Architecture

### Current Structure
The app is a single `App.jsx` file with these sections:

1. **Sample Data** — Arrays of issues, videos, debates, and officials at the top
2. **AI Helper** — `askAI()` function that calls Anthropic API
3. **Shared Components** — `ProgressBar`, `UrgencyBadge`, `StatPill`, `StarRating`
4. **Feature Components:**
   - `IssueCard` — Issue display with support button, stats, AI analysis trigger
   - `VideoCard` — Video thumbnail cards
   - `DebateCard` — Discussion threads with voting
   - `OfficialCard` — Bureaucrat/politician accountability profiles
5. **Modal Components:**
   - `CreateIssueModal` — New issue form with AI draft generation
   - `AIAnalysisPanel` — AI-powered issue analysis overlay
6. **Main App** — `PrajaShaktiApp` with tab navigation, search, filters

### Tab Structure
- **📢 Issues** — Browse, search, filter, support issues. Category filter pills. AI analysis per issue.
- **🎥 Videos** — Grid of citizen video evidence. Upload prompt.
- **⚖️ Debates** — Discussion threads. Agree/Disagree/Nuanced voting. AI debate summaries.
- **🏛️ Officials** — Accountability tracker. Star ratings, pending/resolved stats, response rates.

## Features To Build: Escalation System

This is the core pressure mechanism of PrajaShakti. Build this as a complete feature that integrates with the existing Issues tab. When a user clicks on an issue or selects "Escalate", they enter the escalation flow.

### Phase 1 — Accountability Page
Each bureaucrat/official gets a dedicated accountability page showing:
- Name, designation, office address, jurisdiction
- All issues filed against them with status
- Response timeline (how long they took or haven't responded)
- Citizen rating and public comments
- Photo/video evidence wall from all related issues
- Total number of affected citizens

### Phase 2 — Support Rally System
- Real-time supporter counter with animated progress bar
- Push notification concept (show as in-app notification bell)
- One-tap support button (already exists, enhance it)
- Auto-share to social media (generate share text with issue details)
- Milestone celebrations (100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 supporters)

### Phase 3 — RTI Auto-Generator (AI-powered)
- When user clicks "File RTI", Claude generates a legally formatted RTI application
- Pre-filled with: issue details, relevant department, specific questions to ask
- User can edit before "sending" (in prototype, show the generated document)
- Track RTI status on the issue page (Filed → Acknowledged → Response Due → Overdue)
- Batch RTI: allow multiple citizens to file similar RTIs simultaneously

### Phase 4 — Complaint & Escalation Letters (AI-powered)
- Auto-generate formal complaint letters to:
  - The bureaucrat's superior officer
  - District Collector / Commissioner
  - Relevant State Ministry
  - State Human Rights Commission
  - Lokayukta / Ombudsman
- Each letter is contextual, citing the issue, evidence, and number of affected citizens
- Show escalation as a visual ladder/timeline

### Phase 5 — Escalation Ladder (Auto-escalation)
Build a visual escalation timeline that shows:
```
Day 0: Issue reported → Bureaucrat notified
Day 3: First reminder sent
Day 7: Auto-escalate to Superior Officer
Day 14: Auto-escalate to District Collector
Day 21: Auto-escalate to State Commissioner + Media package triggered
Day 30: Auto-escalate to relevant Ministry + Legal aid options shown
```
- Show this as an interactive timeline on each issue
- Color-code: green (responded), amber (pending), red (overdue)
- Auto-progress based on elapsed time (simulate with sample data)

### Phase 6 — Video Evidence Wall
- Grid/masonry layout of all citizen videos for an issue
- Each video shows: thumbnail, citizen name, date, location, view count
- "Record & Upload" button prominently placed
- Counter: "47 citizens have documented this issue"
- AI-powered summary of all video evidence (what patterns emerge)

### Phase 7 — Social Media Campaign Generator (AI-powered)
- Generate ready-to-post content for Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook
- Include hashtags, tag relevant department handles
- Create a campaign hashtag (e.g., #FixSector14Roads)
- Show viral metrics: impressions estimate, shares target
- "Campaign Kit" with pre-drafted posts citizens can copy-paste

### Phase 8 — Offline Mobilization Organizer
- Event creation: protest, vigil, fast (Upavas/Anushthaan), public meeting
- Location picker, date/time, expected attendance
- RSVP counter
- Auto-generate legal permission application for protests
- Safety guidelines and dos/don'ts
- Live attendance tracker during event

### Phase 9 — Media Package Trigger
When issue crosses threshold (e.g., 10,000 supporters or 100 videos):
- Auto-compile a "Media Package" with:
  - Issue summary (AI-generated press note)
  - Timeline of bureaucratic inaction
  - Key statistics (affected citizens, pending days, escalations sent)
  - Top 5 most impactful citizen videos
  - Official's accountability scorecard
- One-click "Send to Media" (show as ready-to-send package)
- Track media coverage (manual entry in prototype)

### Phase 10 — Permanent Scorecard
- Every official's record persists permanently
- Show trend: improving / declining / stagnant
- Compare officials in same region
- Election season mode: surface scorecards when elections are near

## AI Integration Pattern

All AI features use the same pattern:
```javascript
async function askAI(prompt) {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 1000,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    }),
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.content?.map(b => b.text || "").join("\n") || "Unable to generate response.";
}
```

For new AI features (RTI generator, complaint letters, social media campaigns, media packages), use the same function with well-crafted prompts that include:
- The system context ("You are an assistant for PrajaShakti, an Indian civic engagement platform")
- All relevant issue data (title, location, description, official details, supporter count)
- Specific output format instructions
- "Write in English" and "Keep it factual and actionable"

    constants.js             — Colors, categories, config
  styles/
    theme.js                 — CSS variable definitions
```

## Important Notes

- **No Tailwind** — all styling is inline or CSS variables
- **No external UI libraries** (no Material UI, Chakra, Ant Design)
- **Single-page app** — tab-based navigation, no React Router needed initially
- **Responsive** — works on both mobile (phone-first) and desktop
- **All content is in English** — app name and logo are in Devanagari
- **India-specific context** — RTI Act, 80G tax certificates, Lokayukta, Indian bureaucratic hierarchy
- **The logo is a crimson red (`#DC143C`) inverted triangle** with प्रजाशक्ति written inside
- **AI features gracefully degrade** — if API fails, show helpful error message, rest of app works fine
- **Keep the warm, earthy tone** — not corporate blue, not startup purple. Teal + crimson + off-white warmth.
