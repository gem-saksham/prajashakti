# प्रजाशक्ति — PrajaShakti

**Power of the Citizens**

> यत्र प्रजाशक्तिः तत्र सुशासनम्  
> _"Where there is the power of citizens, there is good governance"_

A civic engagement platform for India. Citizens raise issues, rally support, and hold officials accountable.

---

## What Is This?

PrajaShakti connects citizens in real time to collectively identify public issues, pressure government officials and bureaucrats, and demand accountability. The platform takes micro-donations (as low as ₹1/day), uses a portion for operating costs to stay fully self-sufficient, and donates the rest to randomly selected 80G-certified non-profits. All bank statements are public. No government, political, or corporate funding — ever.

**Framework:** इच्छा (Desire) → ज्ञान (Knowledge) → क्रिया (Action)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20
- Docker + Docker Compose
- (Mobile) Expo Go app on your device, or an Android/iOS emulator

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gem-saksham/prajashakti-mono.git
cd prajashakti-mono
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
# Edit apps/api/.env — defaults work for local development
```

### 3. Start the full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL + Redis + LocalStack
npm run dev            # API (port 3000) + Web (port 5173)
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
cd apps/api && npm run migrate:up
```

### 5. Open the app

- **Web:** http://localhost:5173
- **API:** http://localhost:3000
- **API docs (Swagger):** http://localhost:3000/api/docs
- **Mobile:** `cd apps/mobile && npx expo start`

### Sprint 2 — Issues (Days 16–30) 🔵 Starting Day 16

See [docs/SPRINT_2_KICKOFF.md](docs/SPRINT_2_KICKOFF.md) for the plan.

## Architecture Notes

### Authentication Flow

```
POST /register → OTP sent → POST /verify-otp → { accessToken (15m), refreshToken (30d) }
POST /login    → OTP sent → POST /verify-otp → same
POST /refresh  → new accessToken + new refreshToken (rotation — old token invalidated)
POST /logout   → accessToken blacklisted + refreshToken revoked
```

### Security Model

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model and security measures.

Key protections:

- Rate limiting: 5 OTPs/hour per phone, 3 failed attempts → 15-minute lockout
- Token rotation: each refresh token is single-use; reuse triggers full session revocation
- Input sanitisation: HTML entities escaped in all free-text fields
- Audit logging: all auth events written to `audit_log` table
- Startup security checks: refuses to start in production with weak/missing secrets

### Mobile Avatar Upload

Mobile devices in development cannot reach LocalStack (port 4566 is blocked by Windows Firewall on LAN). Solution:

- **Upload:** `POST /api/v1/users/me/avatar` — mobile sends raw bytes to API → API uploads to S3
- **Display:** `GET /api/v1/media/avatars/*` — API proxies S3 object to device

This same proxy pattern will be used for all media in Sprint 2.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Follow the existing code style (ESLint + Prettier enforced via pre-commit hook)
3. Write tests for new functionality — keep coverage above 60%
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what changed and why

### Code Conventions

- **API:** Service layer for business logic, routes only for HTTP concerns
- **Errors:** Throw `ServiceError(statusCode, code, message)` from services; route catches and forwards
- **Security:** Never log PII; use `redactSensitive()` for any object that might contain secrets
- **Tests:** Integration tests hit real Postgres + Redis (no mocks); unit tests for pure logic
